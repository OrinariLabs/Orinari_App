## Deployment Order

1. Deploy `PaymentGateway.sol` - Core payment processing  
2. Deploy `SpendingLimits.sol` - Spending controls  
3. Deploy `X402Registry.sol` - Service registry  
4. Deploy `RecurringPayments.sol` - Subscription management  
5. Deploy `PaymentSplitter.sol` - Revenue sharing  
6. Deploy `EscrowPayment.sol` - Milestone-based payments  
7. Deploy `PaymentStreaming.sol` - Continuous payment flows  
8. Connect contracts (set addresses for cross-contract calls if needed)  

## Integration with ORINARILabs

The contracts integrate with the **ORINARILabs** Next.js application (`ORINARI_App`) and the $ORINARI token through:

1. **Payment Flow** – Web3 wallet integration for initiating payments via `PaymentGateway`  
2. **Service Discovery** – Query `X402Registry` for available x402-compatible services  
3. **Limit Management** – Users configure spending limits through the UI (`SpendingLimits`)  
4. **Subscription Management** – AI agents can auto-renew service subscriptions (`RecurringPayments`)  
5. **Revenue Sharing** – Automatic payment distribution for multi-party agreements (`PaymentSplitter`)  
6. **Project Payments** – Milestone-based escrow for contracted work (`EscrowPayment`)  
7. **Real-time Billing** – Continuous payment streams for per-second services (`PaymentStreaming`)  

## Security Features

- OpenZeppelin battle-tested contract imports  
- Reentrancy protection on payment functions  
- Access control with Ownable pattern (where used)  
- Input validation on all public functions  
- Event emission for transparency and tracking  

## Testing

Before deploying to mainnet:

1. Deploy to testnet (Sepolia, Mumbai, etc.)  
2. Test all payment flows  
3. Verify spending limits work correctly  
4. Test service registration and discovery  
5. Audit contracts for security vulnerabilities
