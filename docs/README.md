## Overview

**ORINARILabs** is an autonomous AI agent that handles **privacy-preserving payments** on your behalf using the x402 protocol. It enables you to access paid APIs, services, and digital resources without manual intervention—just tell ORINARI what you need, and the agent handles the payment automatically through an Opus/ASCII-styled interface on top of the x402 grid.

> Utility token: **$ORINARI** – used to pay for services and power the ecosystem.

### Key Features

- 🤖 **Autonomous Payments** – AI agent automatically processes HTTP 402 payment flows  
- 🕶️ **Payment Privacy** – request and payment flows are designed to minimize exposed metadata  
- ⚡ **Instant Settlement** – Payments settle in ~2 seconds at blockchain speed  
- 💰 **Zero Platform Fees** – No middlemen, only blockchain gas and service costs  
- 🌐 **Blockchain Agnostic** – Works with Ethereum, Solana, and any x402-compatible chain  
- 🔒 **No Registration** – Access services without accounts, emails, or OAuth  
- 🛡️ **Spending Limits** – Set daily, weekly, and monthly spending caps for safety  
- 📊 **Open Protocol** – Built on the open x402 standard for internet-native payments  
- 🧠 **AI-Powered** – Natural language interface powered by Google Gemini  
- 🧾 **Opus / ASCII UI** – Terminal-like, ASCII-driven interface inspired by Opus experiments

## What is x402?

x402 is an open protocol for internet-native payments built around the **HTTP 402 Payment Required** status code. It enables:

- **Programmatic payments** without accounts or sessions  
- **Direct blockchain transactions** for instant service access  
- **Zero-fee transactions** with no intermediaries  
- **Machine-to-machine commerce** at internet scale

## How ORINARILabs Works

### The Payment Flow

1. **You Make a Request**  
   - Tell ORINARILabs in natural language what service you need  
   - Example: “Get me the latest weather data from WeatherAPI”

2. **ORINARILabs Detects Payment Required**  
   - Service returns HTTP 402 (Payment Required)  
   - ORINARILabs reads the x402 payment details from the response  

3. **Autonomous Payment Processing**  
   - ORINARILabs checks your spending limits  
   - Submits blockchain transaction automatically using $ORINARI (or supported assets)  
   - Waits for payment confirmation (~2 seconds)  

4. **Instant Access**  
   - Retries the original request with payment proof  
   - Receives and presents the data to you in an Opus/ASCII-style interface  
   - All within seconds, zero manual intervention
