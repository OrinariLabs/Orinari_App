# AI Chat Interface

The heart of ORINARI is its intelligent chat interface, powered by our proprietary AI model trained on 72,000+ cryptocurrency tokens. This guide explains how the chat interface works and how to get the most out of your conversations with the AI oracle.

## Overview

The AI chat interface is designed for natural, conversational interaction. You don't need to learn special commands or syntax - just ask questions in plain English, and the AI will understand and respond with detailed, data-driven insights.

## Interface Components

### Main Chat Area

The central chat area displays:

- **Your Messages**: Shown on the right with a distinct background
- **AI Responses**: Streamed in real-time on the left with markdown formatting
- **Timestamps**: Track when messages were sent
- **Loading Indicators**: "ORINARI is thinking..." while processing

### Message Input

Located at the bottom of the interface:

- **Text Input Field**: Type your questions and requests
- **Token Contract Address Field** (Optional): Enter contract addresses for specific token analysis
- **Send Button**: Submit your message (or press Enter)
- **Cooldown Timer**: Shows remaining wait time between messages

### Conversation Starters

Quick-start buttons for common queries:

- "What are the current trending memecoins?"
- "How do I identify a potential rugpull?"
- "Explain pump.fun token graduation"
- "What metrics indicate a healthy token?"

Click any starter to instantly send that query to the AI.

## How the AI Works

### Natural Language Understanding

The AI processes your queries through advanced natural language processing:

**Context Awareness**

AI: [Compares both, remembering Token A details]
```

**Context Reset**

- Refresh the page to start a new conversation
- Context doesn't carry across sessions
- No conversation history stored on servers

## Query Types

### General Questions

Ask broad questions about cryptocurrency:

- "What makes a good memecoin?"
- "Explain how Pump.fun works"
- "What are the risks of low-cap tokens?"
- "How do I evaluate a new project?"

The AI provides educational, comprehensive answers.

### Token Analysis Requests

Request specific token evaluation:

- "Analyze this token: [contract address]"
- "Is [token name] a good investment?"
- "What are the risks of [contract address]?"
- "Compare these two tokens: [address 1] and [address 2]"

The AI fetches real-time data and provides detailed analysis.

### Market Insights

Get current market information:

- "What are today's trending tokens?"
- "Show me the best performing memecoins this week"
- "What's happening in the Solana ecosystem?"
- "Are we in a bull or bear market?"

The AI searches for current information and summarizes trends.

### Risk Assessment

Request security evaluation:

- "Is this token a rugpull?"
- "Check the contract security: [address]"
- "What red flags should I look for?"
- "Evaluate the holder distribution"

The AI analyzes security indicators and provides risk scores.

## Best Practices

### Asking Effective Questions

**Be Specific**

- ❌ "Tell me about tokens"
- ✅ "Analyze the token at address [contract address] for rugpull risks"

**Provide Context**

- ❌ "Is it good?"
- ✅ "Is this token good for a short-term trade or long-term hold?"

**Include Contract Addresses**

- Use the dedicated contract address field
- Or paste directly in your message
- Multiple addresses can be analyzed together

### Getting Better Answers

**Ask Follow-Up Questions**

```
User: "Analyze [token]"
AI: [Provides analysis with risk score: MEDIUM]
User: "What would need to change for it to be LOW risk?"
AI: [Explains specific improvements needed]
```

**Request Clarification**

- If response is too technical, ask for simpler explanation
- Request more details on specific points
- Ask for examples or comparisons

**Use Natural Language**

- No need for formal commands
- Conversational tone works best
- Ask as you would ask a knowledgeable friend

### Understanding Limitations

The AI is powerful but has limits:

**Cannot Predict Prices**

- Won't give price targets or predictions
- Can assess risk but not guarantee outcomes
- Market is inherently unpredictable

**Relies on Available Data**

- Analysis quality depends on data availability
- Very new tokens may have limited information
- Some chains have less data than others

**Not Financial Advice**

- Provides analysis and insights only
- Always do your own research (DYOR)
- Never invest more than you can afford to lose

## Rate Limiting

### The 50-Second Cooldown

After sending a message:

- **Countdown Timer**: Displays remaining time
- **Disabled Input**: Fields locked during cooldown
- **Progress Indicator**: Visual progress bar
- **Persistent**: Survives page refreshes

### Why Rate Limiting?

Necessary for:

- **Fair Access**: Ensures all users can use the platform
- **System Stability**: Prevents overload during high traffic
- **Quality Responses**: AI has time to perform thorough analysis
- **Abuse Prevention**: Stops automated bots and spam

### Working Within Limits

Maximize each query:

- **Ask Comprehensive Questions**: Include all details in one message
- **Multiple Topics**: Can ask about several things at once
- **Batch Analysis**: Include multiple contract addresses
- **Follow-Ups**: Plan your next question while waiting

## Privacy & Security

### Data Handling

Your conversations are private:

- **No Storage**: Messages not saved on servers
- **No Logging**: Conversation history not tracked
- **Session Only**: Context exists only during your session
- **Anonymous**: No user identification or tracking

### Safe Usage

Protect yourself:

- **Never Share**: Don't share private keys or seed phrases
- **Verify Addresses**: Double-check contract addresses
- **Cross-Reference**: Confirm AI findings with other sources
- **Stay Skeptical**: Don't trust blindly, always DYOR

## Tips for Power Users

### Advanced Queries

Get more sophisticated analysis:

**Comparative Analysis**

```
"Compare these three tokens by market cap, holder distribution,
and liquidity: [address1], [address2], [address3]"
```

**Conditional Scenarios**

```
"If this token graduates from Pump.fun, what would be the
expected market cap range based on similar tokens?"
```

**Historical Context**

```
"How does this token's launch pattern compare to successful
memecoins from Q4 2024?"
```

### Efficient Communication

Streamline your workflow:

**Structured Requests**

```
"For [contract address], provide:
1. Risk score with explanation
2. Top 3 red flags
3. Comparison to [similar token]
4. Short-term outlook"
```

**Batch Processing**

```
"Quick risk assessment for these 5 tokens:
[addr1], [addr2], [addr3], [addr4], [addr5]"
```

## Troubleshooting

### AI Not Responding

If the AI seems stuck:

1. Wait 30 seconds for processing
2. Check your internet connection
3. Refresh the page and try again
4. Simplify your query

### Incomplete or Generic Responses

If responses lack detail:

1. Provide more context in your question
2. Include contract addresses when relevant
3. Ask follow-up questions for clarification
4. Specify what type of information you need

### Rate Limit Issues

If cooldown seems incorrect:

1. Check browser local storage
2. Try incognito/private mode
3. Wait for the timer to expire naturally
4. Don't refresh repeatedly (doesn't help)
