## Step 3: Your First Request

Let's make a simple request to understand how Necrona works.

### Try a Basic Query

Type in the chat:

```
What services can you help me access?
```

The AI will respond with information about x402-compatible services and APIs available through the protocol.

### Example Response

```markdown
I can help you access x402-compatible services including:

1. **Data APIs**
   - Weather data APIs
   - Financial market data
   - News and content APIs

2. **AI Services**
   - Image generation (Heurist Mesh)
   - Text processing
   - Data analysis

3. **Storage Services**
   - IPFS pinning (Pinata)
   - Decentralized storage

4. **Web3 Services**
   - Smart contract deployments (thirdweb)
   - Blockchain data APIs

When you need access to any of these, just tell me what you need
and I'll handle the payment automatically!
```

## Step 4: Understanding the Payment Flow

Here's how Necrona handles payments autonomously:

### 1. You Make a Request

```
Get me the current weather data for New York City from WeatherAPI
```

### 2. Necrona Detects Payment Requirement

- The service returns HTTP 402 (Payment Required)
- Necrona reads the x402 payment details
- Shows you the cost: "This will cost 0.001 ETH"

### 3. Autonomous Processing

- Necrona checks your configured spending limits
- Submits blockchain transaction automatically
- Waits for confirmation (~2 seconds)
- Shows transaction hash for transparency

### 4. Instant Access

- Retries the request with payment proof
- Receives the weather data
- Presents formatted results to you
- All within seconds!

## Step 5: Configure Spending Limits (Recommended)

For safety, set spending limits before making payments:

1. **Daily Limit**: Maximum per 24 hours
2. **Weekly Limit**: Maximum per 7 days
3. **Monthly Limit**: Maximum per 30 days

Example limits for testing:

- Daily: 0.01 ETH
- Weekly: 0.05 ETH
- Monthly: 0.2 ETH

> **Note**: Currently, spending limits are managed through smart contracts. See [Configuration Guide](configuration.md) for full setup.

## Step 6: Make Your First Payment Request

Now let's make a real payment request:

```
I need access to premium weather data for the next 7 days in San Francisco
```

The AI will:

1. Find an x402-compatible weather service
2. Show you the pricing
3. Request confirmation
4. Process payment automatically
5. Deliver the data

### What You'll See

```
Finding x402 weather service...
Found: WeatherAPI Premium
Cost: 0.001 ETH (~$2.50)

Proceeding with payment...
✓ Transaction submitted: 0x1234...
✓ Confirmed in 2.1 seconds
✓ Accessing data...

Here's your 7-day forecast for San Francisco:

## Understanding the Interface

### Chat Interface

- **Message Input**: Type natural language requests
- **Streaming Responses**: See AI responses in real-time
- **Markdown Formatting**: Responses use headers, lists, and formatting
- **Transaction Links**: Click to view on block explorer

### Transaction History

Each payment shows:

- Service name
- Amount paid
- Transaction hash (clickable)
- Timestamp
- Status (pending/confirmed/failed)

## Best Practices

### 1. Start Small

❌ Bad: Set daily limit to 10 ETH without testing
✅ Good: Start with 0.01 ETH daily limit while learning

### 2. Be Specific

❌ Bad: "Get me some data"
✅ Good: "Get weather data for NYC from WeatherAPI"

### 3. Monitor Spending

Check your transaction history regularly to:

- Track spending against limits
- Verify service costs
- Review transaction hashes

### 4. Verify Services

Before using a new x402 service:

- Check if it's verified in the registry
- Read reviews from other users
- Start with small test payments

### 5. Keep Wallet Funded

Ensure you have enough for:

- Service payment costs
- Blockchain gas fees
- Small buffer for multiple requests

## Common First-Time Questions

### Q: Is my wallet connected?

A: Necrona uses your browser wallet (MetaMask, etc.). You'll be prompted to connect when making your first payment.

### Q: How much does it cost?

A: Necrona charges **0% platform fees**. You only pay:

- Service provider fees (varies by service)
- Blockchain gas fees (typically $0.01-$1.00)

### Q: What if a payment fails?

A: Failed payments are automatically refunded. The blockchain transaction will show the refund.

### Q: Can I cancel a payment?

A: Once submitted to the blockchain, transactions cannot be cancelled. However, if the service doesn't deliver, you can dispute through the smart contract.

### Q: Which blockchains are supported?

A: Necrona is blockchain agnostic and supports:

- Ethereum
- Solana
- Any x402-compatible chain

### Q: Are my conversations saved?

A: No. Chats are not stored on servers. Refresh to start fresh.
