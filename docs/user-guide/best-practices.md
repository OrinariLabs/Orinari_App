# Tips and Best Practices

Master ORINARI and cryptocurrency analysis with these proven strategies, tips, and best practices from experienced users.

## General Principles

### 1. Always DYOR (Do Your Own Research)

ORINARI is a powerful tool, but never your only source:

✅ **Do:**

- Use ORINARI as your starting point
- Cross-reference findings with blockchain explorers
- Check social media and community channels
- Verify contract addresses manually
- Read project documentation
- Research the team

❌ **Don't:**

- Blindly trust any single source
- Skip verification steps
- Invest based on AI alone
- Ignore your intuition

### 2. Start Small

Never risk more than you can afford to lose:

**Position Sizing:**

- 🟢 LOW Risk: Max 5-10% of portfolio
- 🟡 MEDIUM Risk: Max 2-5% of portfolio
- 🔴 HIGH Risk: Max 0.5-1% of portfolio (if at all)

**First Investment:**

- Test with very small amounts
- Learn the platform's feel
- Understand token behavior
- Build experience before scaling

### 3. Have an Exit Strategy

Know when to sell BEFORE you buy:

**Define:**

- Profit targets (e.g., 2x, 5x, 10x)
- Stop loss levels (e.g., -20%, -30%)
- Time horizons (day trade, swing, hold)
- Red flag triggers for immediate exit

**Stick to it:**

- Don't let emotions override strategy
- Take profits at targets
- Cut losses at stops
- Exit if new red flags appear

## Using ORINARI Effectively

### Asking Better Questions

**Be Specific:**

```
❌ "Is this good?"
✅ "Is [contract address] safe for a 3-day swing trade?"
```

**Provide Context:**

```
❌ "Tell me about this token"
✅ "Analyze [address] focusing on liquidity lock status
   and holder distribution. I'm risk-averse."
```

**Batch Related Queries:**

```
❌ Sending 5 separate questions
✅ "For [token]: risk score, top red flags, comparison
   to [similar token], and short-term outlook"
```

### Interpreting Results

**Read Completely:**

- Don't just skim the risk score
- Understand WHY the score is what it is
- Note specific red flags
- Check source citations

**Look for Patterns:**

- Multiple red flags = compounding risk
- Improving metrics = positive trend
- Worsening metrics = exit signal
- Conflicting signals = dig deeper

**Ask Follow-Ups:**

```
Initial: "Analyze [token]"
Follow-up: "You mentioned whale concentration - how does
that compare to successful similar tokens?"
```

### Timing Your Analysis

**Before Buying:**

- Full analysis mandatory
- Check during different times
- Monitor for 24-48h if possible
- Verify data hasn't changed

**While Holding:**

- Weekly check-ins minimum
- After major news/events
- If price moves significantly
- Before adding to position

**Before Selling:**

- Confirm reasons for exit
- Check if fundamentals changed
- Ensure not selling at worst time
- Verify no new positive developments

## Token Evaluation Workflow

### Step 1: Initial Screening

Ask ORINARI:

```
"Quick risk assessment for [address]"
```

**Decision Point:**

- 🔴 HIGH risk → Skip, move on
- 🟡 MEDIUM risk → Proceed to Step 2
- 🟢 LOW risk → Proceed to Step 2

### Step 2: Deep Analysis

Ask ORINARI:

```
"Comprehensive analysis of [address] including
holder distribution, liquidity lock status,
contract security, and comparison to similar tokens"
```

**Evaluate:**

- All risk factors
- Specific red flags
- Green flags present
- Overall risk/reward

**Decision Point:**

- Acceptable risk → Proceed to Step 3
- Unacceptable risk → Skip

### Step 3: External Verification

**Check:**

- Contract on blockchain explorer
- Social media (X, Telegram)
- Chart on DexScreener
- Community sentiment
- Team background (if not anonymous)

**Decision Point:**

- Everything checks out → Proceed to Step 4
- Something feels off → Skip

### Step 4: Position Planning

**Determine:**

- Position size (based on risk)
- Entry price/strategy
- Profit targets
- Stop loss level
- Holding period

### Step 5: Execute & Monitor

**After Entry:**

- Set price alerts
- Schedule check-ins
- Monitor ORINARI for changes
- Stay updated on project news
- Be ready to exit

## Risk Management

### Diversification

**Never:**

- Put everything in one token
- Overconcentrate in high risk
- Ignore correlation (all similar tokens)

**Instead:**

- Spread across multiple tokens
- Mix risk levels
- Different market caps
- Various launch dates
- Multiple blockchains

### Position Sizing Formula

```
Max Position Size = (Account Size × Risk %) / Token Risk Multiplier

Risk Multipliers:
- LOW risk (🟢): 1x
- MEDIUM risk (🟡): 2-3x
- HIGH risk (🔴): 5-10x

Example:
$10,000 account, willing to risk 5% per token

LOW risk token: $10,000 × 5% / 1 = $500 max
MEDIUM risk token: $10,000 × 5% / 2.5 = $200 max
HIGH risk token: $10,000 × 5% / 7.5 = $67 max
```

### Stop Losses

**Set Before Entry:**

- Price-based: "Exit at -25%"
- Time-based: "If not up in 3 days, exit"
- Event-based: "If liquidity drops, exit immediately"

**Common Levels:**

- Conservative: -15 to -20%
- Moderate: -25 to -35%
- Aggressive: -40 to -50%

**Honor Them:**

- Don't move stops lower
- Exit without hesitation
- Better safe than sorry
- Preserve capital for next trade

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake #2: Ignoring Red Flags

**Problem:**

- "But the chart looks good!"
- Rationalizing away concerns
- Hoping scam indicators are wrong

- Better opportunities exist

### Mistake #3: Oversizing Positions

**Problem:**

- Too much in one token
- Account at risk
- Emotional decision making
- Unable to sleep

**Solution:**

- Leave room for other plays

### Mistake #4: No Exit Plan

**Problem:**

- Holding through dumps
- Missing profit targets
- Indecision at key moments

**Solution:**

- Set targets before buying
- Automate with limit orders

- Know your exit triggers

### Mistake #5: Revenge Trading

**Problem:**

- Lost on token A
- Immediately buy token B to recover
- Emotional, rushed decisions
- Compound losses

**Solution:**

- Take breaks after losses
- Process emotions first
- Return with clear mind
- Accept losses as part of trading

### Mistake #6: Trusting Influencers

**Problem:**

- "X said it's going 100x!"
- Following calls blindly
- Not doing own analysis

**Solution:**

- Everyone has incentives
- Many are paid promoters
- Do your own research
- Use ORINARI to verify

## Advanced Strategies

### Layered Entry

Instead of buying all at once:

**Strategy:**

```
Total planned: $500
Entry 1: $150 at current price (test position)
Entry 2: $150 after 24h if still looks good
Entry 3: $200 if metrics improving
```

**Benefits:**

- Test hypothesis with small capital
- Average entry price
- Confirm analysis over time
- Lower risk

### Partial Profit Taking

Don't sell all at once:

**Strategy:**

```
Total holding: 100,000 tokens
Sell 25% at 2x (recover half initial investment)
Sell 25% at 5x
Sell 25% at 10x
Sell 25% at 20x or let it ride
```

**Benefits:**

- Lock in profits
- Reduce stress
- Still exposed to upside
- Can't lose after first target

### ORINARI + Chart Combo

Combine AI analysis with technical analysis:

**Process:**

1. Use ORINARI for fundamental analysis
2. Check chart for technical setup
3. Both must align for entry
4. Use technical for timing, AI for validation

**Example:**

- Seer shows LOW risk = ✅
- Chart shows breakout pattern = ✅
- Entry confirmed

### Correlation Monitoring

Track related tokens:

**Strategy:**

```
Ask ORINARI:
"Compare these three similar tokens:
[token A], [token B], [token C]
Which has the best risk/reward?"
```

**Benefits:**

- Find best in category
- Avoid weakest performers
- Understand sector trends
- Better capital allocation
