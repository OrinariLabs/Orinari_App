# Making Payments with ORINARI

This guide walks you through making your first autonomous payment and understanding the payment process.

## Quick Start

### 1. Connect Your Wallet

First, connect a Web3 wallet:

- Click "Connect Wallet" button
- Choose MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, or another provider
- Approve the connection

### 2. Make a Request

Tell ORINARI what you need:

```
"Get me weather data for San Francisco"
```

### 3. Review Payment

ORINARI will show you:

```
Found: WeatherAPI Premium
Cost: 0.001 ETH (~$2.50)
✓ Within spending limits
```

### 4. Automatic Processing

Payment happens automatically:

- Transaction submitted
- Confirmed in ~2 seconds
- Service accessed
- Data delivered

## Detailed Payment Flow

### Step 1: Service Discovery

When you make a request, ORINARI:

1. **Parses your intent**: Understands what service you need
2. **Queries x402 Registry**: Finds compatible services
3. **Checks availability**: Ensures service is online
4. **Retrieves pricing**: Gets current cost

### Step 2: Pre-Flight Checks

Before processing payment:

```
Checking:
✓ Wallet connected
✓ Sufficient balance (0.01 ETH available)
✓ Within daily limit (0.003/0.01 ETH used)
✓ Within weekly limit (0.015/0.05 ETH used)
✓ Within monthly limit (0.08/0.2 ETH used)
✓ Service verified
```

### Step 3: Transaction Construction

ORINARI builds the transaction:

```javascript
{
  to: servicePaymentAddress,
  value: "0.001 ETH",
  data: paymentProofData,
  gas: estimatedGas,
  nonce: nextNonce
}
```

### Step 4: Signing & Submission

Your wallet automatically:

- Signs the transaction
- Submits to blockchain
- Returns transaction hash

### Step 5: Confirmation

Wait for blockchain confirmation:

```
Transaction: 0x1234...
Status: Pending...
Block: Waiting...
───────────────────
✓ Confirmed in block 12345678
✓ 2.1 seconds elapsed
```

### Step 6: Service Access

With payment confirmed:

1. ORINARI retries service request
2. Includes payment proof in headers
3. Service validates payment
4. Returns requested data
